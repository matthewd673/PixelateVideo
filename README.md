# PixelateVideo

Pixelate videos with the power of Pixelator and FFMPEG.

**[Download the Repository](https://bitbucket.org/matthewd673/pixelatevideo/downloads/)**

If you're unfamiliar with VS folder structures, **the actual program is located in `PixelateVideo\bin\Debug\`.**

## Set up

### Pixelator

If you don't already have Pixelator, you can get it [here](http://pixelatorapp.com/index.html).

### Actually using PixelateVideo

- Follow the prompts next to the textboxes to fill in the correct information.

- In most cases, you can just leave the frames set to "all".

- Pixelator arguments are provided at the bottom of the window in Pixelator.

- The output file path should end with a backslash (e.g.: "C:\my\output\path\")

- When providing the path to Pixelator, provide a path to _pixelator_cmd.exe, not Pixelator.exe

- When providing Pixelator arguments, only input from the first command with "--" in front of it to the end!

## Additionally...

FFMPEG is free software available [from the project's homepage](https://ffmpeg.org/).
I do not claim ownership of the FFMPEG binary included with this project.
